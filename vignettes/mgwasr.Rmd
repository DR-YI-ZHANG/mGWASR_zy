# Overview

## Introduction

**mGWASR** contains the R functions and libraries underlying the [mGWAS-Explorer](https://www.mgwas.ca/) web server. After installing and loading the package, users will be able to reproduce the same results from their local computers using the corresponding R command history downloaded from mGWAS-Explorer, thereby achieving maximum flexibility and reproducibility.

Following installation and loading of *mGWASR*, users will be able to reproduce web server results from their local computers using the corresponding R command history downloaded from mGWAS-Explorer, thereby achieving maximum flexibility and reproducibility.

## Installation

**Step 1. Install package dependencies**

To use mGWASR , first install all package dependencies. Ensure that you are able to download packages from bioconductor. To install package dependencies, use the pacman R package (for those with \>R 3.5.1). Note that some of these packages may require additional library dependencies that need to be installed prior to their own successful installation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pacman")

library(pacman)

pacman::p_load(RSQLite, igraph,  BiocParallel,  pryr,  httr,  reshape,  ggplot2,  RJSONIO,  RCurl,  XML,  ggforce,  graphlayouts,  compiler,  dplyr,  RColorBrewer,  Cairo,  plyr,  qs,  rjson,  TwoSampleMR)

```

**Step 2. Install the package**

mGWASR is freely available from GitHub. The package documentation, including the vignettes for each module and user manual is available within the downloaded R package file. If all package dependencies were installed, you will be able to install the mGWASR. Due to issues with Latex, some users may find that they are only able to install mGWASR without any documentation (i.e. vignettes).

Install the package directly from github using the *devtools* package. Open R and enter:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Step 1: Install devtools
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

# Step 2: Install mGWASR WITHOUT documentation
devtools::install_github("xia-lab/mGWASR", build = TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual", "--no-build-vignettes"), force = TRUE)

# Step 2: Install mGWASR WITH documentation
devtools::install_github("xia-lab/mGWASR", build = TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), build_vignettes = TRUE, force = TRUE)

```

# Tips for using the mGWASR package

1)  The first function that you will use in every module is the `InitDataObjects` function, which constructs the *dataSet* object that stores user's data for further processing and analysis.

2)  The mGWASR package directly creates data files/tables/analysis/networks outputs in your current working directory.

3)  Every command must be run in sequence, please do not skip any commands as this will result in errors downstream.

4)  Each main function in mGWASR is documented. Use the *?Function* format to open its documentation. For instance, use `?mGWASR::QueryExposure` to find out more about this function.

# Obtain statistical associations and biological mappings

## Starting from a list of metabolites

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(mGWASR)

#### Initiate the dataSet object for storing processed data
mSet<-InitDataObjects("met2snp")

#### Set cmpdListFile as a file containing your compound list 
cmpdListFile<-"replace_with_your_file_name.txt"

####  Read in the cmpdListFile, this will import a plain text file as single character string
cmpdList<-readChar(cmpdListFile, file.info(cmpdListFile)$size)

```

Note, for users to prepare a list of metabolites, they can copy and paste a list into a plain text file, which can then be uploaded to R. These steps include: 1) Set working directory to location of your files for analysis; 2) Set your list of features as "cmpdListFile" in Rpkgdown::build_site()

3)  Read in the text file for analysis using readChar, saving it as "cmpdListFile"

# Perform two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to establish a causal relationship between an exposure (e.g., metabolite) and an outcome (e.g., disease). Two-sample MR (2SMR) uses summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for both the exposure and the outcome. In this tutorial, we will guide you through performing two-sample MR in R using the *mGWASR* package.

## Load and prepare exposure and outcome data

In two-sample MR, you need summary statistics from separate GWAS for exposure and outcome. The dataset for the exposure should contain SNPs that are significantly associated with the exposure. The dataset for the outcome should contain the effects of these SNPs on the outcome. The datasets must have columns for SNP, effect size, and standard error.

Load the exposure and outcome data:

## Harmonize exposure and outcome data

Harmonizing the data ensures that the genetic variants are aligned between the exposure and outcome datasets:

## Perform two-sample MR

Here's a brief explanation of the commonly used methods you can choose:

1)  **Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) Method** (`mr_ivw`): The basic idea here is to use each genetic variant as a separate instrumental variable and to combine the individual causal effect estimates using a meta-analysis approach. The main assumption is that the genetic variants are valid instrumental variables, i.e., they are associated with the exposure, not associated with confounders of the exposure-outcome relationship, and affect the outcome only through the exposure.

-   **Pros**: It's the most common method, easy to understand, and provides precise estimates under ideal conditions.

-   **Cons**: It is sensitive to invalid instrumental variables (pleiotropy). In such cases, the results may be biased.

2)  **Weighted Median Method** (`mr_weighted_median`): This method calculates the median of the ratio estimates, but each ratio estimate is weighted by the inverse of its variance. This method provides a consistent estimate of the causal effect even when up to 50% of the information comes from invalid instrumental variables (those that violate the MR assumptions). If the weighted median estimate is similar to the standard MR estimate, it suggests that the results are robust to violations of the MR assumptions by some of the genetic variants.

-   **Pros**: It provides a valid causal effect estimate even when up to 50% of the weight in the analysis comes from invalid instrumental variables.

-   **Cons**: It is less efficient (i.e., has larger standard errors) than the IVW method when all genetic variants are valid instrumental variables.

3)  **MR-Egger Method** (`mr_egger_regression`): This method is similar to the IVW approach, but allows the intercept term in the regression model to be non-zero, which can be an indication of pleiotropy. This analysis allows for the potential existence of pleiotropy, where a single gene or genetic variant affects more than one trait. The intercept from the MR-Egger regression provides a measure of the average pleiotropic effect across all genetic variants. A non-zero intercept can indicate directional pleiotropy, which could bias the MR estimates. The slope in MR-Egger regression provides a causal estimate that is corrected for pleiotropy.

-   **Pros**: It can provide an unbiased estimate even when all genetic variants are invalid, as long as the pleiotropic effects of the genetic variants are uncorrelated with their associations with the exposure.

-   **Cons**: It is less efficient than the IVW and weighted median methods and may have low statistical power.

4)  **Wald ratio** (`mr_wald_ratio`): The Wald Ratio is one of the most straightforward methods. In the Wald ratio method, each genetic variant is used as an instrumental variable, and the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome is estimated as the ratio of the genetic association with the outcome to the genetic association with the exposure. This is done for each genetic variant, and then the results can be combined across genetic variants, for example by taking the average.

-   **Pros**: The Wald ratio is simple to calculate and easy to interpret. It does not require complex statistical modeling or software.

-   **Cons**: Assumptions: The Wald ratio assumes that the genetic variant is associated with the exposure, does not affect the outcome through any pathway other than the exposure (no horizontal pleiotropy), and is not associated with any confounders of the exposure-outcome relationship. If these assumptions are violated, the Wald ratio may give biased estimates. Sensitivity to weak instruments: The Wald ratio can give imprecise estimates if the genetic variant is weakly associated with the exposure, which can be a particular problem when there is only one genetic variant available as an instrumental variable.

The choice of method will depend on the specific context of the analysis. If you strongly believe that the genetic variants are valid instrumental variables, the IVW or Wald ratio method would be good choices. If you are unsure about the validity of the instrumental variables, the weighted median or MR-Egger method might be more appropriate. However, it's often a good idea to use several methods and compare the results to assess the robustness of your findings. If the different methods give similar results, this can increase your confidence in the causal effect estimate.

To perform the two-sample MR analysis, choose an appropriate MR method (e.g., inverse variance weighted [IVW] method). Run the analysis using the selected method:

## Perform directionality analysis

## Perform sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analyses in Two-Sample MR are essential to validate the main findings and to assess the robustness of the MR estimates against violations of the key assumptions. Here are the most common sensitivity analyses in Two-Sample MR and how to interpret their results:

-   Heterogeneity test: Testing for heterogeneity in a 2SMR analysis involves assessing whether the causal effect estimates from different SNPs are consistent with each other.

    The `mr_heterogeneity()` function returns a list with the following components:

    - Q: The Cochran's Q statistic, which is a measure of the weighted sum of squared differences between individual SNP estimates and the overall MR estimate. A large Q statistic relative to its degrees of freedom suggests heterogeneity.

    - Q_df: The degrees of freedom, which is equal to the number of SNPs minus 1.

    - Q_pval: The p-value for the Q statistic. A low p-value (e.g., less than 0.05) suggests that there is significant heterogeneity.

- Pleiotropy test: This test is based on MR-Egger regression and specifically tests the null hypothesis that the intercept from the MR-Egger regression is equal to zero. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it suggests that there is horizontal pleiotropy, meaning that the genetic variants used as instrumental variables affect the outcome through pathways that are not mediated by the exposure.

    The `mr_pleiotropy_test()` function returns a list with the following components:

    - pval: The p-value for the intercept from the MR-Egger regression. A low p-value (e.g., less than 0.05) suggests that there is significant horizontal pleiotropy.

    - egger_intercept: The intercept from the MR-Egger regression, which provides a measure of the average pleiotropic effect across all genetic variants.

- intercept_stderr: The standard error of the intercept.

If the p-value (pval) is less than a certain significance level (e.g., 0.05), it suggests that there is significant pleiotropy. This means that at least some of the genetic variants used as instrumental variables are affecting the outcome through pathways that are not mediated by the exposure, which could bias the MR estimates.


## Interpret results

**Review the table results**

The output will display the causal estimate, its standard error, and the p-value. A significant p-value (\< 0.05) suggests a causal relationship between exposure and outcome.

**Scatter plot**

The scatter plot in a MR analysis is typically used to visualize the relationship between genetic associations with the exposure (on the x-axis) and the outcome (on the y-axis). Each point on the plot represents a single genetic variant (also known as a single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP).

Here's how you interpret the scatter plot:

1)  Slope and Linearity: The slope of the line fitted through the points is an estimate of the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome. If the points are scattered around a straight line with a positive slope, it suggests that an increase in exposure is associated with an increase in the outcome, indicating a positive causal effect. Conversely, if the points are scattered around a straight line with a negative slope, it suggests that an increase in exposure is associated with a decrease in the outcome, indicating a negative causal effect.

2)  Scatter around the line: If the points are closely clustered around the line, it suggests that the genetic variants are good instruments (i.e., they satisfy the assumptions of MR). If the points are widely scattered, it suggests potential violation of the MR assumptions, such as presence of pleiotropy (where a single gene affects more than one trait), or measurement error.

3)  Outliers: Outliers are points that lie far from the line of best fit. These might represent genetic variants that have pleiotropic effects, or that are affected by measurement error or linkage disequilibrium (where genetic variants are inherited together more often than would be expected by chance). Outliers can bias the MR estimate, so it's important to consider sensitivity analyses (like MR-Egger regression or leave-one-out analysis) that can help assess the impact of potential outliers on the MR results.

**Forest plot**

A forest plot in a 2SMR analysis provides a visual representation of the causal effect estimates for each SNP, as well as the overall causal effect estimate.

Here's how you interpret a forest plot in MR analysis:

1)  Individual SNP estimates: Each horizontal line in the forest plot represents one SNP. The point on the line indicates the estimated causal effect of the exposure on the outcome for that SNP. The length of the line represents the confidence interval for that estimate.

2)  Overall MR estimate: This is usually represented at the bottom of the plot. The center of the point represents the combined estimate of the causal effect across all SNPs (i.e., the overall MR estimate), and the width of the point represents the confidence interval for the overall estimate.

3)  Direction of effect: If the point estimates are mostly on the right side of the line of no effect (usually represented by a vertical line at 0), it suggests that the exposure increases the risk of the outcome. If they're mostly on the left side, it suggests that the exposure decreases the risk of the outcome.

4)  Heterogeneity: If the individual SNP estimates are widely scattered, it suggests that there is heterogeneity in the causal estimates.

5)  Influence of individual SNPs: If removing one SNP from the analysis changes the overall MR estimate substantially, it suggests that the SNP may be exerting undue influence on the results.

**Leave-one-out plot**

The leave-one-out (LOO) analysis is a sensitivity analysis used in MR. It assesses the influence of each individual SNP on the overall causal effect estimate. In this analysis, the MR is rerun multiple times, each time leaving out one SNP, to see how much the overall estimate changes.

Here's how you interpret a leave-one-out plot in MR analysis:

1)  Influence of individual SNPs: Each point on the LOO plot represents the overall MR estimate obtained when that SNP is excluded from the analysis. If removing a particular SNP changes the overall MR estimate substantially, it suggests that this SNP may be exerting undue influence on the results.

2)  Consistency of the MR estimate: If all the points on the LOO plot are close to the overall MR estimate, it suggests that the MR estimate is consistent and not unduly influenced by any single SNP.

3)  Identifying outlier SNPs: If there are one or more points that are far from the overall MR estimate, these are outlier SNPs that may be violating the assumptions of MR. These SNPs might be worth further investigation to understand why they are outliers.

4)  Confidence intervals: The LOO plot usually also shows the confidence intervals for each leave-one-out MR estimate. If these intervals overlap substantially, it suggests that the MR results are robust to the exclusion of individual SNPs.

**Funnel plot**

A funnel plot in a 2SMR analysis is used to assess potential bias in the causal effect estimates, often due to pleiotropy. The plot is a scatter plot of the precision of each SNP's causal effect estimate (on the y-axis) against the estimate itself (on the x-axis).

Here's how you interpret a funnel plot in MR analysis:

1)  Symmetry: In the absence of bias, the plot should be symmetrical around the vertical line that represents the overall causal effect estimate. This is because each SNP's estimate is expected to vary randomly around the true causal effect, with higher precision estimates (those closer to the top of the plot) varying less than lower precision estimates (those closer to the bottom). If the plot is asymmetrical, it suggests that there may be bias in the MR estimates.

2)  Direction of bias: If the points on the plot are mostly to the right of the overall estimate, it suggests that there is positive bias (i.e., the estimates are skewed towards positive values). If the points are mostly to the left, it suggests that there is negative bias (i.e., the estimates are skewed towards negative values).

3)  Pleiotropy: Asymmetry in the funnel plot can be a sign of pleiotropy, where a gene influences the outcome through more than one pathway. This violates one of the key assumptions of MR and can bias the results.

4)  Heterogeneity and outliers: A widely scattered plot or the presence of outlier points far from the vertical line can indicate heterogeneity in the causal estimates or the presence of outlier SNPs, which could be due to pleiotropy, linkage disequilibrium, or measurement error. These SNPs might be worth further investigation.

5)  Precision: Points towards the top of the plot are SNPs with higher precision estimates (smaller standard errors), while points towards the bottom are SNPs with lower precision estimates (larger standard errors).
